# 1. SQL Introduction
### Structured Query Language (SQL) 
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system.

#### MySQL:
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. Its name is combinations of “My”, the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.

#### SQL Query:
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard computer language for relational database management and data manipulation. SQL is used to query, insert, update and modify data.

#### Database:
A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.

#### RDBMS:
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) based on the relational model of data. Most databases in widespread use today are based on this model.

#### Schema:
A drawing that represents an idea or theory and makes it easier to understand. A database schema of a database system is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system.

#### Normalization:
Normalization is the process of organizing data to avoid duplication and redundancy.

##### First Normal Form	For a table to be in the First Normal Form, it should follow the following 4 rules:
1. It should only have single (atomic) valued attributes/columns.
2. Values stored in a column should be of the same domain
3. All the columns in a table should have unique names.
4. And the order in which data is stored, does not matter.

##### Second Normal Form	For a table to be in the Second Normal Form,
1. It should be in the First Normal form.
2. And, it should not have Partial Dependency.

##### Third Normal Form	A table is said to be in the Third Normal Form when,
1. It is in the Second Normal form.
2. And, it doesn't have Transitive Dependency.

##### Boyce and Codd Normal Form	A table is said to be in the Third Normal Form when,
1. It is in the Second Normal form.
2. And, it doesn't have Transitive Dependency.

##### Fourth Normal Form	A table is said to be in the Fourth Normal Form when,
1. It is in the Boyce-Codd Normal Form.
2. And, it doesn't have Multi-Valued Dependency
